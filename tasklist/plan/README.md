# Task Planning Files Generated

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Conflict Graph Generation

## Files Created

### 1. dependency_graph.json
Contains dependency relationships between all 21 tasks from the TASKLIST.md:
- **Total Tasks:** 21 (T1.1 through T5.4)
- **No Dependencies:** 3 tasks (T1.1, T1.2, T2.4)
- **Size Distribution:**
  - Large (L): 2 tasks (~45-48 min each)
  - Medium (M): 8 tasks (~18-24 min each)
  - Small (S): 11 tasks (~6-12 min each)
- **Total Sequential Time:** ~369 minutes (~6.15 hours)

### 2. task_descriptions.json
Comprehensive task descriptions including:
- Task ID and summary
- Detailed description
- Size and runtime estimates
- Dependency lists
- Tags for categorization
- Enabler flag (T1.5 marked as enabler with 15% acceleration)

### 3. files_list.json
File patterns for each task showing:
- Exact file paths for new/modified files
- Regex patterns for file groups
- File type indicators (exact, regex)

## Dependency Highlights

### Critical Path (P0 tasks):
- T1.1 → T1.3 → T1.4 → T2.1 → T2.2 → T5.2 → T5.4

### Parallel Opportunities:
- **Wave 1:** T1.1, T1.2, T2.4 (3 tasks can start immediately)
- **Wave 2:** T1.3, T1.5 (depends on T1.1, T1.2)
- **Independent branches:**
  - Documentation tasks (T4.x) have lighter dependencies
  - Testing tasks (T3.x) can parallelize after infrastructure

### Enabler Task:
- **T1.5** (Test Infrastructure) - Marked as enabler with:
  - 15% acceleration effect
  - Scope: backend and testing tags
  - Half-life: 2 waves

## File Conflict Analysis Preview

Potential conflict areas to watch:
1. **Backend API files:** T1.3 and T1.4 both touch backend/api/
2. **Documentation:** Multiple tasks (T2.3, T4.x) modify README files
3. **Security audit (T5.2):** Broad scope across backend and frontend
4. **Optimization (T5.3):** Overlaps with COM provider and AI service files

## Next Steps

1. **Run Conflict Detection:**
   ```bash
   python .github/dev/dev_scripts/generate_conflict_graph.py
   ```

2. **Generate Execution Plan:**
   ```bash
   python .github/dev/dev_scripts/generate_parallel_execution_plan.py
   ```

3. **Review Initial Metrics:**
   - Check time_savings_percent (target: >35%)
   - Verify average_parallelism (target: >2.0)
   - Confirm max_parallelism (target: 4+)

4. **Iterate if Needed:**
   - Split large tasks if bottlenecks found
   - Refine file patterns to reduce false conflicts
   - Adjust dependencies if parallelism is low

## Task Summary by Phase

### Phase 1: COM Backend (5 tasks, ~129 min)
- T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T1.4, T1.5
- Critical foundation layer

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (4 tasks, ~48 min)
- T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4
- Lighter dependencies, good parallelization potential

### Phase 3: Testing & Automation (4 tasks, ~96 min)
- T3.1, T3.2, T3.3, T3.4
- T3.1 (E2E) is the longest single task (48 min)

### Phase 4: Documentation (4 tasks, ~36 min)
- T4.1, T4.2, T4.3, T4.4
- Mostly independent, can parallelize well

### Phase 5: Post-Implementation (4 tasks, ~60 min)
- T5.1, T5.2, T5.3, T5.4
- T5.4 (UAT) is on critical path

## Expected Optimization Opportunities

1. **Split T3.1 (E2E tests, 48 min):**
   - T3.1a: Email processing tests (20 min)
   - T3.1b: Task management tests (15 min)
   - T3.1c: Visual regression tests (13 min)

2. **Merge small doc tasks:**
   - Combine T4.3 + T4.4 if no conflicts (12 min total)

3. **Refine T5.2 patterns:**
   - Security audit has very broad scope
   - May cause false conflicts with optimization tasks
