## âœ… COMPLETED: System is now user-agnostic and ready for GitHub

### Files Modified

#### Prompts Updated
- **`prompts/email_classifier_system.prompty`**
  - Removed hardcoded "Azure Compute Node Services engineer" reference
  - Removed specific technical details (IMDS, WireServer, AHG, etc.)
  - Added dynamic inputs: `job_role_context` and `classification_rules`
  - Now loads user-specific data at runtime

- **`prompts/summerize_action_item.prompty`** 
  - Removed hardcoded role reference
  - Now uses generic job context

#### Scripts Enhanced  
- **`scripts/ai_processor.py`**
  - Added `get_job_role_context()` method
  - Added `get_classification_rules()` method  
  - Updated `_create_email_inputs()` to include new dynamic data
  - Enhanced file path management for user data

#### New User Data Files Created
- **`user_specific_data/job_role_context.md`** - Role and responsibilities
- **`user_specific_data/classification_rules.md`** - Email classification logic

#### New Setup & Testing Scripts
- **`scripts/setup_user_data_templates.py`** - Creates template files for new users
- **`scripts/test_user_data.py`** - Verifies user data loading works correctly
- **`USER_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide for new users

### âœ… Verification Tests Passed
- âœ… User data files load correctly
- âœ… Username loading: `ameliapayne`
- âœ… Job Role Context: 972 characters loaded
- âœ… Classification Rules: 2561 characters loaded  
- âœ… Job Context: 901 characters loaded
- âœ… Job Skills: 1465 characters loaded

### ðŸ”’ Security Features
- âœ… `user_specific_data/` automatically added to `.gitignore`
- âœ… No personal job information in repository code
- âœ… Template system for easy new user setup
- âœ… Clear separation between code and personal data

## How It Works Now

1. **Setup**: New users run `python setup_user_data_templates.py`
2. **Customize**: Users edit template files with their job information  
3. **Runtime**: AI processor loads user data dynamically during email processing
4. **Classification**: Emails are classified using user's specific rules and context

## Repository Status

ðŸŽ‰ **READY FOR GITHUB**: The repository no longer contains any hardcoded personal job information. Anyone can:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script  
3. Fill in their own job details
4. Use the system with their personalized context

## Original User-Specific Data Extracted

The following personal information has been moved to user data files:
- Azure Compute Node Services engineer role
- IMDS, WireServer, AHG technical details
- Security Champion responsibilities  
- Specific work areas and technical keywords
- Classification priorities specific to your job

All of this is now configurable per user while maintaining the same AI functionality.
