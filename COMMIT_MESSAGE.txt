### AI Improvements
- Dynamic confidence: AI-generated scores (0.0-1.0) instead of hardcoded 0.8
- Job context integration: Newsletter summaries personalized to user's role
- Category-specific prompts: Newsletter/FYI use tailored prompty files

### Code Quality
- Removed 30+ console.log statements
- Full TypeScript type safety maintained
