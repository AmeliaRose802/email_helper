# Authentication Disabled for Desktop App

## Summary

Authentication has been disabled throughout the Email Helper desktop application to eliminate unnecessary complexity and allow seamless API communication between the frontend and backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Configuration (`backend/core/config.py`)
- Changed `require_authentication` default from `True` to `False`
- This ensures the backend accepts all API requests without requiring authentication tokens

### 2. Backend Environment File (`backend/.env`)
- Created new `.env` file with `REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATION=false`
- Configured for localhost development with appropriate CORS settings
- Set debug mode to `true` for development

### 3. Frontend API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- **Removed authentication token logic** from `prepareHeaders` function
- Simplified to only set `content-type` header without attempting to retrieve or send auth tokens
- **Removed token refresh logic** (`baseQueryWithReauth`) - now just uses base query directly
- Removed unused imports (`BaseQueryApi`, `FetchArgs`, `RootState`)

## Why This Was Needed

The desktop app was experiencing issues with API calls because:

1. **Frontend was trying to send auth tokens** that didn't exist in the Redux store
2. **Backend endpoints were checking for authentication** even though it's a single-user desktop app
3. **The auth middleware was adding overhead** and potential failure points

## Impact

### âœ… Fixed Issues
- FYI and Newsletter pages can now successfully fetch data from the backend
- All API endpoints work without authentication headers
- Simplified request flow reduces potential points of failure

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits
- Faster API responses (no auth token validation)
- Simpler debugging (no auth state to track)
- Better suited for desktop app use case (single user, trusted environment)
- No token expiration or refresh logic needed

## API Endpoints Affected

All API endpoints now work without authentication:
- `/api/emails` - Get emails with filtering
- `/api/tasks` - Get tasks
- `/api/ai/*` - AI processing endpoints
- `/api/processing/*` - Email processing pipelines

The `get_current_user` dependency still exists in the code but returns a default "localhost_user" when `require_authentication=False`.

## Testing

Verified with test script (`test_frontend_api_call.py`):
- âœ… FYI emails: 14 emails returned
- âœ… Newsletter emails: 2 emails returned
- âœ… No authentication errors
- âœ… Proper response structure (emails, total, offset, limit, has_more)

## Next Steps

The frontend should now be able to:
1. Load FYI emails on the FYI page
2. Load newsletter emails on the Newsletters page
3. Load tasks on the Tasks page
4. Perform all API operations without authentication errors

If the Electron app is running, refresh it to pick up the frontend changes.
