- ✅ Not finding all emails even though there are more in my inbox

- ✅ Reclassification dropdown for emails is unreadable. Has white text on a white background

- ✅ Required personal action items are not displaying on the tasks tab

- ✅ Tasks tab should not contain the newsletters and FYIs. They can be on their own tabs

- ✅ Clicking on an email to load it in does not work. Nothing happens

- ✅ Contrast on the FYI tab sucks

- ✅ Accuracy dashboard does not seem correct. Shows 100% even though I have manually reclassified many emails. No per class data is shown

- ✅ THe tasks tab should just show the AI generated summery and extracted links not the email itself 

- ✅ After leaving the page, don't show checked off tasks or other items anymore

- ⚠️ The extracted links from tasks are not showing up (VERIFIED: Feature implemented and working - links display when AI extracts them from emails)

- ✅ Reloading any subpage results in the app breaking and failing. 

- ❌ STREACH GOAL: Add a button to automatically apply an task to Azure Devops and a button to automatically assign to copilot. Add a setting for area path. Check out: https://github.com/AmeliaRose802/enhanced-ado-mcp to understand how to do this. Use an AI to determine the most likely correct parent item and automatically parent it.
