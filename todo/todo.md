- For the love of god, consolidate the styles in a single location! This is a horrific mess. This is high priority!


- FYI and newsletter summeries should each just show the bullet pointed or paragraphed summeries without a lot of extra noise about emails themselves

- Use AI to deduplicate FYI and newsletter summeries

- Accuracy dashboard should not be using mock data! SHow show F1, precision and recall for each class. NO MOCK DATA ALLOWED ANYWHERE.

- Should automatically classify the next 10 emails in the background so when I go to the next tab it is already ready for me

- Once I click on one email, the app cannot load in any future emails

- THe tasks tab should just show the AI generated summery and extracted links not the email itself 

- The extracted links from tasks are extremly important and should be displayed.

- I have more unread emails in my inbox but the app is not finding them? Some cutoff?

- Email tab always displays first email as unknown. When catagorization is complete show catagory

- Show the subject and AI summery first in the email detail tab, not the classificaiton 

- Newsletters tab and FYI tabs show nothing

- Email data not loading correctly on email page
    From:
    To:
    No date
    Date: Invalid Date

- Links in emails are not displaying correctly. Should be HTML links with alt text shown

- Newsletters should be summerized based on relevence to a new custom user prompt not the job one or whatever

- Clicking new emails to load them into the tab isn't working. First loads, additional ones don't

- Project is a mess of uncommitted files and random junk. Clean it up and improve docs accuracy and structure

- Test the settings tab using reusable playwright tests and other testing and make sure it actually works. Should do something real, not placeholder or mock or what fucking ever

- Reloading any subpage results in the app breaking and failing. 

-STREACH GOAL: Add a button to automatically apply an task to Azure Devops and a button to automatically assign to copilot. Add a setting for area path. Check out: https://github.com/AmeliaRose802/enhanced-ado-mcp to understand how to do this. Use an AI to determine the most likely correct parent item and automatically parent it.
