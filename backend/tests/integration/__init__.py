"""Integration tests for Email Helper backend services.

This package contains integration tests that verify the interaction between
multiple components of the backend system, including:

- COM Outlook adapter integration
- AI processing service integration
- Full end-to-end workflow testing

These tests use mocking to simulate external dependencies (Outlook COM, Azure OpenAI)
while testing the actual integration logic between components.
