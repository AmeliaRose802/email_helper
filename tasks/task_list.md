# TODO

- ✅ Not all folders should be under inbox and included in the inbox count. The fyi, newsletters, optional events and team actions should not be under inbox

Improvements:

- ✅ SUmmery should be opened in app rather then directing us to the browser

- When we go to the review panel, the summery should be populated automatically instead of having to click a button

- However we should also include links to open the emails themselves in either outlook or the web version? Let me know the complexity of doing this. Store the entry ID and use it to create a link to the relevant email.

- Record all human accepted suggestions which were applied to outlook, not just the changed ones in the review view. This will allow us to have better data for fine tuning.

- Should be able to select a column to sort by

- Use some heruistic to retreve labeled examples similar to the current email from the modification suggestions. Then inject these examples into the prompt for few shot prompting.

- In the GUI, list emails by category for faster review

- If there are no items in a section, don't include it in the summery
