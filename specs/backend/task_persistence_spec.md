# Task Persistence Component Specification

**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025  
**File:** `src/task_persistence.py`  
**Purpose:** Task lifecycle management and data persistence system

## üéØ Purpose

The TaskPersistence component manages the complete lifecycle of email-derived tasks, providing secure storage, retrieval, and tracking capabilities. It serves as the **TASK DATABASE** ensuring no action items are lost and all progress is tracked.

**CRITICAL:** This component enables task management functionality that transforms emails into actionable work items. Without it, users lose the ability to track and manage their email-derived tasks.

## üîß Core Features

**CRITICAL: These features MUST NOT be removed or modified without user approval**

### 1. Task Storage and Persistence

- **Purpose:** Securely stores all task data to prevent loss and enable tracking
- **Method:** `save_task(task_data)` - MUST persist task data to filesystem safely
- **Storage Format:** MUST use JSON for human-readable and recoverable task data
- **File Management:** MUST handle file locking, concurrent access, and corruption recovery
- **Backup:** MUST create backup copies before modifying existing task files

### 2. Task Retrieval and Loading

- **Purpose:** Loads stored tasks for display and management in the GUI
- **Method:** `load_all_tasks()` - Returns all tasks with complete metadata
- **Filtering:** MUST support loading by status, date range, priority, and category
- **Performance:** MUST handle large task collections efficiently with pagination
- **Data Integrity:** MUST validate loaded data and handle corrupted files gracefully

### 3. Task Status Management

- **Purpose:** Tracks task completion states and progress over time
- **Method:** `update_task_status(task_id, new_status)` - Updates task state safely
- **Status Types:** MUST support pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled states
- **History Tracking:** MUST maintain status change history with timestamps
- **Synchronization:** MUST ensure status updates are immediately persisted

### 4. Task Completion Tracking

- **Purpose:** Manages task completion workflow and completion metadata
- **Method:** `mark_task_completed(task_id, completion_notes)` - Completes task safely
- **Completion Data:** MUST record completion time, notes, and outcome
- **Validation:** MUST verify task exists and is in completable state
- **Notifications:** MUST trigger completion events for GUI updates

### 5. Task Search and Filtering

- **Purpose:** Enables finding specific tasks across large task collections
- **Method:** `search_tasks(query, filters)` - Returns matching tasks
- **Search Types:** MUST support text search across description, notes, and metadata
- **Filter Options:** MUST filter by status, date, priority, category, and source
- **Performance:** MUST use indexing for fast search across thousands of tasks

### 6. Task Metadata Management

- **Method:** `update_task_metadata(task_id, metadata)` - Updates task properties
- **Metadata Types:** MUST include creation date, due date, priority, tags, source email
- **Validation:** MUST validate metadata format and required fields
- **History:** MUST track metadata changes with timestamps and reasons

### 7. Task Export and Import

- **Purpose:** Enables task data portability and backup/restore operations
- **Method:** `export_tasks(format, filters)` - Exports task data in specified format
- **Export Formats:** MUST support JSON, CSV, and XML export formats
- **Import Validation:** MUST validate imported data and handle conflicts
- **Data Mapping:** MUST map external formats to internal task structure

### 8. Task Analytics and Reporting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Preservation Notes

### NEVER Remove These Methods:

1. `__init__(self)` - Constructor MUST initialize storage paths and configuration
2. `save_task(task_data)` - Core task persistence functionality
3. `load_all_tasks()` - Task retrieval and loading engine
4. `update_task_status(task_id, new_status)` - Task status management

6. `search_tasks(query, filters)` - Task search and filtering
7. `update_task_metadata(task_id, metadata)` - Task metadata management
8. `export_tasks(format, filters)` - Task data export functionality
9. `import_tasks(data, format)` - Task data import functionality
10. `generate_task_analytics(timeframe)` - Task analytics and reporting

### NEVER Change These Attributes:

- `self.task_storage_path` - Directory path for task file storage
- `self.backup_path` - Directory path for task backup files
- `self.task_index` - In-memory task index for fast searching
- `self.current_tasks` - Cache of currently loaded tasks
- `self.file_lock` - File locking mechanism for concurrent access

### NEVER Modify These Status Constants:

- `PENDING` - Task created but not started
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Task currently being worked on
- `COMPLETED` - Task finished successfully
- `CANCELLED` - Task cancelled or no longer needed
- `OVERDUE` - Task past its due date

### NEVER Remove Data Validation:

- Task ID uniqueness validation MUST be enforced
- Required field validation MUST prevent incomplete tasks
- Date validation MUST ensure logical date relationships
- Status transition validation MUST enforce valid state changes
- Data corruption recovery MUST handle file system errors

## üß™ Validation

### Unit Tests Location

- Primary: `test/test_task_persistence_comprehensive.py`
- Integration: `test/test_enhanced_ui_comprehensive.py`

### Manual Validation Steps

1. **Task Creation:** Verify tasks are created and stored correctly
2. **Data Persistence:** Confirm tasks survive application restarts
3. **Status Updates:** Test all status transitions and history tracking
4. **Search Functionality:** Validate search across various criteria
5. **File Corruption:** Test recovery from corrupted task files
6. **Concurrent Access:** Verify multiple process access safety
7. **Export/Import:** Test data portability and format conversion

### Success Criteria

- Tasks are created and stored without data loss
- Task data persists correctly across application restarts
- Status updates are immediately reflected and historized
- Search returns accurate results across all criteria
- File corruption is detected and recovered gracefully
- Concurrent access does not cause data corruption
- Export/import maintains data integrity and completeness

## üö® Integration Impact

### GUI Dependencies

- **Task Lists:** Depends on task data format and status constants
- **Progress Tracking:** Depends on status history and analytics data
- **Search Interface:** Depends on search method parameters and results
- **Export Features:** Depends on export format support

### Data Flow Dependencies

- **Input:** Email-derived task data from EmailProcessor and AIProcessor
- **Processing:** Task lifecycle management and persistence operations
- **Output:** Structured task data for GUI display and analytics
- **Storage:** File system persistence with backup and recovery

### Breaking Changes Impact

- Changing task data structure breaks GUI display components
- Modifying status constants breaks workflow and GUI logic
- Removing methods breaks task management functionality
- Changing file formats breaks data persistence and recovery

### Performance Considerations

- Large task collections MUST use efficient indexing and pagination
- File operations MUST be optimized to prevent GUI blocking
- Search operations MUST scale with task database size
- Memory usage MUST be managed for large task collections

### Security Considerations

- Task data MUST be stored securely with appropriate file permissions
- Backup files MUST be protected from unauthorized access
- Task export MUST not expose sensitive email content
- File locking MUST prevent data corruption from concurrent access

**üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDER: This component ensures no tasks are lost and provides the foundation for email-to-task workflow. Any changes that break task persistence will result in loss of user productivity data and task tracking capabilities.**
