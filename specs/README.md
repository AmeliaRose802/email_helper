- `prompty_integration_spec.md` - Prompty template system integration

## üö® Critical Usage Rules for AI Systems

### **BEFORE MODIFYING ANY CODE:**
1. **READ THE RELEVANT SPECIFICATION** - Always consult the appropriate spec file before making changes
2. **VERIFY FEATURE PRESERVATION** - Ensure all features listed in specifications are maintained
3. **UPDATE SPECIFICATIONS** - If adding new features, update the relevant spec file
4. **CHECK DEPENDENCIES** - Review integration specs for any external system impacts

### **WHEN REFACTORING:**
1. **PRESERVE ALL LISTED FEATURES** - Every feature in these specifications MUST be maintained
2. **MAINTAIN API COMPATIBILITY** - Do not change method signatures or data structures without updating specs
3. **KEEP INTEGRATION POINTS** - All external integrations must continue working as specified
4. **VERIFY WORKFLOWS** - Ensure end-to-end workflows remain functional

### **NEVER:**
- Remove features listed in specifications without explicit user approval
- Change critical method signatures without updating specifications
- Break integration points described in integration specs
- Modify workflow steps without verifying the complete process still works

## üìñ Specification Format

Each specification file follows a consistent, AI-friendly format:

```markdown
# Component/Feature Name

## üéØ Purpose
Clear description of what this component does and why it exists

## üîß Core Features  
**CRITICAL: These features MUST NOT be removed**
- Feature 1: Description and importance
- Feature 2: Description and importance

## üìä Data Structures
Key data formats and structures used

## üîó Dependencies
What this component depends on and what depends on it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Preservation Notes
Specific warnings about features that are easy to accidentally remove

## üß™ Validation
How to verify this component is working correctly
```

## üîç How to Use These Specifications

### For Developers:
1. Read the relevant spec before modifying any component
2. Use specs to understand feature dependencies and interactions
3. Update specs when adding new features
4. Reference specs during code reviews

### For AI Systems:
1. **ALWAYS** read the specification for any component you're modifying
2. Verify that ALL features listed as "CRITICAL" are preserved
3. Check integration specs before changing API interfaces
4. Use workflow specs to understand the impact of changes on user processes

### For Quality Assurance:
1. Use specs as acceptance criteria for testing
2. Verify that all specified features are working
3. Test complete workflows as described in workflow specs
4. Validate external integrations per integration specs

## üö® Emergency Feature Recovery

If features are accidentally removed:

1. **Consult the relevant specification** to understand what was lost
2. **Check the comprehensive test files** in `/test/` folder for validation
3. **Review git history** using specification descriptions to find the last working version
4. **Restore features** exactly as described in the specification

## üìù Specification Maintenance

- Specifications are **living documents** that must be updated when features change
- Each specification includes a "Last Updated" timestamp
- Changes to specifications should be reviewed and approved
- Outdated specifications are worse than no specifications
