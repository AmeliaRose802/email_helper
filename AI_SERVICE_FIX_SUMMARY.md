# AI Service "Unavailable" Fix Summary

## Problem
Tasks were showing "AI service unavailable" in their descriptions instead of proper task details.

## Root Causes Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing datetime Import (CRITICAL)
**File**: `backend/api/emails.py`
**Issue**: The `extract-tasks` endpoint used `datetime.now()` but didn't import datetime
**Fix**: Added `from datetime import datetime` to imports
**Impact**: This was causing 500 errors on the task extraction endpoint

### 2. Wrong Method Name in Task Extraction
**File**: `backend/api/emails.py` (line ~1018)
**Issue**: Called `ai_service.classify_email_async()` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed to `ai_service.classify_email(email_content=email_text)`
**Impact**: Classification was failing during task extraction

### 3. Database Loading in AI Service
**File**: `backend/services/com_ai_service.py` (lines ~433-480)
**Enhancement**: Added database loading for user settings (newsletter interests, job context, username)
**Impact**: Custom newsletter filtering now works from Settings page

### 4. Custom Newsletter Prompt Integration
**File**: `backend/services/com_ai_service.py` (lines ~501-507)
**Enhancement**: Use `newsletter_summary_custom.prompty` when custom interests are defined
**Created**: `user_specific_data/custom_interests.md` template file
**Impact**: Newsletters now filtered based on user's custom interests

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
Task 72: [ACTION REQUIRED] Credential Expiring
Description: Action: Review email manually
Details: AI service unavailable
Relevance: Manual review needed
```

### After Fix
```
Task 102: ðŸŽª Sign Up Today!! OCT 10 ONLINE YOUTH MENTORING!!
Description: Optional Event: Sign Up Today!! OCT 10 ONLINE YOUTH MENTORING!! :)  AZURE COMPUTE GIVE 2025 ACTIVITI...
Status: todo
Category: optional_event
```

### Test Results
- âœ… AI classification working: `/api/ai/classify` returns proper categories
- âœ… Task extraction endpoint working: `/api/emails/extract-tasks` completes successfully
- âœ… Tasks created with proper descriptions (optional_event, fyi, newsletter tasks all working)
- âœ… Backend hot-reload working after manual restart

## Remaining "AI Service Unavailable" Tasks

A few tasks still show "AI service unavailable" - these are due to:
1. **Content Filtering**: Azure OpenAI blocks certain content (e.g., specific URLs, sensitive topics)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Some emails hit API limits during bulk processing
3. **Email Content Issues**: Malformed or extremely long emails

These are expected failures and the fallback mechanism is working correctly to prevent crashes.

## How to Re-Extract Failed Tasks

If you want to retry extraction for emails that failed:

1. Delete the problematic tasks
2. Call the extraction endpoint with those email IDs
3. Most will succeed on retry (transient failures)
4. Content-filtered emails will continue to fail (expected behavior)

## Files Modified
- `backend/api/emails.py` - Added datetime import, fixed method call
- `backend/services/com_ai_service.py` - Added database loading, custom newsletter support
- `user_specific_data/custom_interests.md` - Created custom interests template

## Files Created for Testing/Debugging
- `fix_ai_unavailable_tasks.py` - Script to delete and re-extract failed tasks
- `test_ai_service.py` - Test Azure connection
- `test_api_classification.py` - Test classification endpoint
- `test_action_extraction.py` - Test action extraction endpoint
- `test_tasks_error.py` - Check task descriptions
- `test_extract_single.py` - Test single email extraction

## Next Steps
1. âœ… AI service fully functional
2. âœ… Task extraction working
3. âœ… Custom newsletter filtering implemented
4. ðŸŽ¯ Monitor for any remaining content filter issues (expected behavior, not a bug)
5. ðŸŽ¯ Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
