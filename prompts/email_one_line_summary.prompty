## Email to Summarize
**Subject:** {{subject}}  
**From:** {{sender}}  
**Date:** {{date}}

Generate a one-line summary for this email.

- Maximum 120 characters
- Focus on actionable content or key information
- Use active voice when possible
- Be specific about what the email is asking for or providing

## Examples

Good summaries:
- "Manager requesting quarterly budget review by Friday"

- "Training session invitation for new security protocols"
- "Job application deadline extended to September 15th"
- "Survey feedback requested for team development program"

Return only the summary line, nothing else.
