- No action items - just awareness information
- Use clear, professional language

Examples:
• System maintenance scheduled for Azure services this weekend
• New security policy update effective October 1st
• Office building renovation starting next month
• Team restructuring announcement - no immediate impact

Return only the bullet point, nothing else.
